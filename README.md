# Data Analytics and Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio This collection of projects, case studies, and presentations highlights my skills in data visualization, statistical analysis, and machine learning.

Please note that some projects may be older but recently up;oaded and may not represent my current level of expertise. While I've strived to maintain quality and best practices, these projects may still be works in progress or have areas for improvement.

I'm excited to share my journey of growth and learning in the field of data analytics and data science.

Let's dive in!
